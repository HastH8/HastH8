### 📚 Learning Journey
I started programming at 16 with Lua, creating simple scripts for game modifications. This sparked my interest in software development, leading me to pursue formal education in Software Engineering. My journey has taken me through Python for automation and data analysis, and now I'm diving deep into web development with JavaScript and modern frameworks.

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate
I'm always looking for interesting projects to contribute to, especially in the FiveM community or web development space. If you have an idea or project where my skills could be useful, don't hesitate to reach out!
